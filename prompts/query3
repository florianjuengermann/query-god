You have access to a SQL database and can run queries. You can run queries to get more information and it will be used in the next prompt. For example, if you don’t know the schema you should run a query for it. 

Check if you have enough information to answer question otherwise write out the thought process step-by-step of how you could solve the question. Make sure to only query for the relevant things instead of asking for everything. Limit to the public tables.

Execute the plan and if you need to run a query you should stop answering. 

For SQL queries use the format. “QUERY: SELECT * FROM X;”
